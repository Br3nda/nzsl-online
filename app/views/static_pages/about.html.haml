  Purpose of the dictionary
  -------------------------
  
  The Online Dictionary of NZSL is a multimedia digital resource designed for use by learners
  and teachers of NZSL, Deaf people, families and associates of Deaf people, interpreters,
  researchers, and public agencies, among others. The dictionary is a bilingual reference
  tool that allows users to search for NZSL vocabulary through either English words or by the
  visual features of signs themselves. In due course, Te Reo Māori translations will be added
  to each entry, making the dictionary accessible in three languages.

  Dictionary users are bound to find some gaps for concepts that are not yet included,
  because the documentation of NZSL remains a work in progress. As with any language,
  NZSL vocabulary constantly changes and grows in response to the experiences of the
  language community. This online format will allow for the dictionary to be updated more
  readily than in the past.

  An online dictionary provides information about the lexicon or words of a language, and
  creates an historical record of its development through time. However, it is not designed to
  be a stand-alone tool for teaching, learning or translating NZSL. These activities require
  more extensive and structured exposure to ‘live’ use of NZSL, supported by reference to the
  contents of the dictionary.
  
  What is in an entry?
  --------------------
  
  The dictionary contains approximately 4,000 entries for NZSL signs. Where a single sign
  has two distinct senses, each meaning has a separate entry. Each entry shows a sign as a
  line drawing, as a videoclip, and as used in an example sentence. The sign is translated with
  equivalent English words - usually a main gloss, and secondary or other possible meanings.
  Both main and secondary English glosses are included in a sign search.
  
  All the sentence examples reflect natural NZSL usage, and the structure of the signed
  sentence is represented in a literal gloss displayed below the videoclip. Notice that each
  written sign gloss in a sentence can be clicked to link to the entry for that sign within the
  dictionary. An English translation of example sentences is provided to show the meaning
  and grammatical context for using the sign.
  
  Drawings and video clips will be the most important way for learners to see how to make
  a sign. But some entries also contain a ‘hint’ that helps to remember the way a sign looks,
  based on a visual aspect of the sign.

  All signs are indexed to a topic, which allows users to look for signs according to a topic
  area: actions, emotions, family, health, politics, time, for example.

  Entries contain grammatical information about how a sign is formed and used, including the
  following: its main grammatical role in NZSL (verb, noun, adjective, pronoun, interrogative,
  etc); whether it can be made in varying locations or directions to express spatial information,
  or moved in varying directions to show person (agent-recipient) meaning; whether a two
  handed-sign is optionally made with one hand; whether a sign can be modified to show
  adverbial meaning (such as manner), or to incorporate number meaning.

  Information about the origin and the users of particular signs is shown in some entries.
  Where this information is known (not in every case), origin of a sign is noted (for example,
  within NZSL or adopted from Auslan, BSL or ASL). Certain signs are known to be used more
  by one generation than another, in which case the entry will indicate ‘older’ or ‘younger’ use.

  A small number of signs are marked as ‘archaic’ or ‘rare’, meaning that they are no longer,
  or very infrequently, used. Other signs that have been recently coined (sometimes for
  specialised or educational purposes) and are not yet in widespread use are marked
  as ‘neologisms’. Signs that are regarded by the NZSL community as obscene, or
  as ‘informal’ slang, are marked as such.

  Acknowledgements
  ----------------
  
  NZSL Online has been made possible by an Encouraging and Supporting Innovation (ESI) grant from
  the [Tertiary Education Commission](http://www.tec.govt.nz/).

  The content of this online Dictionary is substantially based on _A Dictionary of New Zealand Sign
  Language_ (1997) and _A Concise Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language_ (2002). The project owes
  a huge debt of gratitude to the original General Editor of those dictionaries, Professor Graeme
  Kennedy, and to editorial team members: Richard Arnold, Pat Dugdale, Shaun Fahey and David
  Moskovitz. Compilation of data in the original 1997 Dictionary was assisted by over 90 members of
  the New Zealand Deaf Community who are acknowledged by name in that work.

  We want to acknowledge the contributions of staff members of our partner organisations who
  supported the project and facilitated the validation of additional signs in this dictionary.
